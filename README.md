# Zsh first timers
Who doesn't like zsh? Oh... guess everyone likes bash.

## Bash or Zsh?
Today I'm here to answer the question: **Is bash better than zsh?**

### What is ZSH?
Wait, you don't know what zsh is? *I-i-ts li-i-k-e th-e **sigh***. Ok, let me just give you a quick rundown.

**In apple's eyes**: I literally cannot find documentation for this but I found this: *The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting.*

Nah, that's the opposite. I mean kinda but still, please send me a issue if you find the *actual* documentation. Now, let me just say whats ZSH autually is.

**ZSH** is the default shell script for MacOS. They used to have the bash shell but I guess they got bored. It's full form is actually the Z shell. Honestly thats way better than having to say ZSH all the time so here it is. Z shell has many components. It not only takes bash components but also ksh and tcsh, whatever those are.

Z shell is not only used in mac but can be basically used in every single operating system. If you are confused, I suggest opening your terminal and run the following command: 
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
Then, you must install the Z shell with it. Next, replace the default shell (eg: `bash`) with the Z shell. Remember the `.bashrc` file that used to run on startup? Well now say goodbye to that cause we get `.zshrc`!


My friend used to have a iMac computer and I'm too timid to replace my default shell. But we got github codespaces so whats wrong?

### The Github Codespaces Experienceâ„¢
Here it is..
**Disclaimer**: I will document *everything*. By the way, I don't use git directly in VSC.
* I literally deleted my experience here so yeah.
