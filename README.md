# Zsh first timers
Who doesn't like zsh? Oh... guess everyone likes bash.

## Bash or Zsh?
Today I'm here to answer the question: **Is bash better than zsh?**

### What is ZSH?
Wait, you don't know what zsh is? *I-i-ts li-i-k-e th-e **sigh***. Ok, let me just give you a quick rundown.

**In apple's eyes**: I literally cannot find documentation for this but I found this: *The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting.*

Nah, that's the opposite. Please send me a issue if you find the *actual* documentation. Now, let me just say whats ZSH autually.

**ZSH** is the default shell script for MacOS. They used to have the bash shell but I guess they got bored.
